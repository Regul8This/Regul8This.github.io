# Regul8This Validator
## Downtime on 2 Dec 2021
It may have come to your attention that the validator went down today. It turns out that this issue that affected the Regul8This validator is a random error that is a known issue. It is going to be [fixed in upcoming releases.](https://discord.com/channels/789009413976883220/902960166071336960/916065157803802694 "FRA Discord Message")

Unfortunately, the randomness of the error did not prevent this validator from being affected. Ultimately, I had to restore from a backup then run the complete [validator initialization script](https://wiki.findora.org/assets/files/node_init_mainnet-31289365a9595aeb7188096f269a876c.sh) again. That brought the validator back online.

There are still [errors being thrown](https://discord.com/channels/789009413976883220/902960166071336960/916099287211974706), though the validator is back online and processing blocks.

Regul8This validator apologizes for the problem and the downtime. We will be working with the dev team to ensure that we upgrade to the patched version as soon as it is available.
